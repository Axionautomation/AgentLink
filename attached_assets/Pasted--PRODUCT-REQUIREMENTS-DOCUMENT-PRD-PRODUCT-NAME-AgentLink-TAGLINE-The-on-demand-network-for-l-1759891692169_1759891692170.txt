AgentLink

TAGLINE

The on-demand network for licensed real estate professionals.

OVERVIEW

AgentLink connects licensed real estate agents who need temporary coverage (for showings or open houses) with qualified local agents available to perform the job ‚Äî like Uber for realtors. The system uses GPS verification, escrow payments, and in-app chat to ensure accountability, transparency, and seamless coordination.

The MVP will focus on matching, job posting, secure payments, and verified check-in/out through GPS. Later versions will integrate AI for optimized matching, scheduling, and performance analytics.

OBJECTIVES

Enable on-demand coverage: Allow agents to post and claim showing/open-house jobs.

Ensure trust and compliance: Verify all agents‚Äô licenses and attendance (via GPS).

Provide seamless communication: Real-time chat and status updates.

Automate payments: Escrow and payout upon completion.

Lay the foundation for scalable AI-driven matching and analytics.
