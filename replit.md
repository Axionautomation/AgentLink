## Recent Changes (Latest Session)
**Phase 1: Core Features**
- Implemented interactive Leaflet map with MarkerClusterGroup for job clustering
- Added NotificationBell component with dropdown, mark-as-read, and real-time updates
- Built Wallet page with real transaction data, period-based earnings, and balance calculations
- Created license verification workflow: upload form, admin review queue, approval/rejection

**Phase 2: Security Hardening**
- Added isAdmin boolean field to users table (default: false)
- Implemented isAdmin middleware for admin route authorization
- Protected storage.upsertUser by stripping isAdmin from all input (prevents privilege escalation)
- Added frontend guard to AdminLicenses page (redirects non-admin users)
- License endpoint explicitly preserves isAdmin status (cannot be changed by users)
- Passed architect security review: No privilege escalation vulnerabilities

**Phase 3: Payment Checkout & Withdrawals**
- Created dedicated Checkout page with Stripe Payment Element (includes Link by Stripe for one-click payments)
- Added PaymentSuccess page to handle 3DS authentication redirects
- Updated CreateJob flow to redirect to checkout instead of inline payment
- Added bank account fields to users schema (Financial Connections integration ready)
- Implemented withdrawal/payout system with instant payout endpoints
- Added withdrawal UI to Wallet page with amount input and bank account display
- **Critical Security Fix**: Corrected balance calculation to subtract completed payouts from escrow releases (prevents double-withdrawal attacks)
- All payment and withdrawal features passed architect security review

**Admin Setup Instructions:**
To create admin users, run SQL directly on the database:
```sql
UPDATE users SET is_admin = true WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```
Note: isAdmin cannot be set via API for security reasons

   - PaymentIntent captured
   - Escrow release transaction recorded
   - Platform fee transaction recorded
   - Agent receives 80% payout
   - Notifications sent

- GPS validation doesn't account for building height/indoor accuracy (acceptable for MVP)
- Admin users must be created via SQL (by design for security)

### User Preferences
- Follow Material Design 3 principles
- Prioritize mobile-first design
- Use orange as primary brand color
- Maintain clean, professional aesthetic
- Emphasize trust and reliability in UI
